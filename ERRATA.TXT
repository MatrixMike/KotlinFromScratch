Identified errors/typos:

1. P35: Add ":" after "greet" in the first example of lambda expressions. The correct code is:
   val greet: (String) -> String = { name -> "Hello, $name!" }

2. P40: There are a couple of typos ("_") in the last line of the code example. The correct code is:
   println("Copied inputfile.txt to outputfile.txt")

3. P167: There is a typo right after "scroll" is created. The correct code is:
   scroll.content = root

4. P170: In the 2nd-last paragraph from the bottom of the page, it says that "Both of these functions 
   call the singleXYChart() function (which we discussed and used in Chapter 3)." While Chapter 3 
   presents examples of drawing bar and line charts, this exact function is not discussed there. 
   However, the full function is included in the GitHub repository (see Project 16 under Chapter 4).
  
   Note: The same function name is also used in Chapter 5. This version of the function is used for
   plotting a single line chart per plot. However, the version required for Project 16 in Chapter 4
   (as shared on GitHub) is for plotting multiple line charts on the same plot.

5. P210: The denominator in Equation 5.24 should be r^2 (r squared), not r sub 2.
